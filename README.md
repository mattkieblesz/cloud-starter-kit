# Cloud Starter Kit

The goal of this project is to provide full technology stack for robust web application development and deployment and yet allow to make changes easily.

Another intention is to make it interesting, easy to play with and learn. This are desired project features which will be implemented in my free time.

**General**

* always latest stable versions of everything
* easily customizable tech stack
* plug and play
* optimized for high traffic
* cost effective cloud production provider
* secure workflow ready to use by larger teams
* you don't need to spend a buck to test simulated production and development environments

**Client**

* MVC on client side
* HTML/CSS framework of your choice
* designed for screens of all sizes
* test first setup

**Server**

* restful API
* oauth2 server implementation
* search of your choice
* isomorphic MVC thanks to client framework of your choice
* queuing infrastructure
* email server
* message queuing
* test first setup

**Development workflow**

* development, staging and production environments with just a few commands
* continuous integration with code reviews, test coverage checks and linting
* production error reporting
* using gitflow
* debugging & optimization tools
* A/B testing
* automation system of your choice

**High scalability**

* load balancing
* relational database clustering and sharding
* NoSQL solutions
