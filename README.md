## Installation

You need to setup your remote store for all current configuration/management purposes. For this we use s3 bucket so you
need to update your global aws credentials and config file (located in `conf` directory). Also update `conf/services.yml` file which will be used to setup local environment. Then run `make configure`
to link files.

Then just run `sudo make setup` to install all requirements and update vendor roles with `make update-roles`. Done.

## Resource naming convention

In order to simplify life we assume one resource provider account will be used. Therefore there needs to be naming
which will include:
- environment
- location
- role
- resource number

Examples: `prd-lo-web-1`, `dev-ir-db-1`, `prf-fr-db-1`, `stg-lo-celery-3`, `mgt-lo-ci-1`
